## 📝 Project Description:

This Power BI project is a case study focused on analyzing a real-world job posting dataset to support the strategic goals of a fictional recruitment company called DataSearch. The goal of this analysis is to uncover actionable insights related to job market trends, particularly focusing on Data Scientist, Data Analyst, and Data Engineer roles. 

The project follows a structured approach:

1. Data Cleaning & Preparation: Using Power Query, the dataset was cleaned, transformed, and made analysis-ready.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Initial trends, outliers, and data distributions were explored.
3. Market Trend Analysis: DAX measures and visualizations were created to analyze skill demands, job titles, locations, company trends, and more.
4. Dashboard Development: A fully interactive Power BI dashboard was developed, enabling the DataSearch team to explore insights through slicers, filters, and dynamic visuals.
