# Getting Started
Power BI is a business analytics and data visualisation tool developed by Microsoft that enables users to connect to various data sources, transform and model data, and create interactive reports and dashboards. Professionals widely use it to uncover insights, track KPIs, and make data-driven decisions across different industries. 

Power BI provides a user-friendly interface with drag-and-drop features and supports advanced capabilities like DAX calculations, Power Query transformations, and integration with Azure and Excel. The desktop version, called Power BI Desktop, is available for free and can be downloaded either from the [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/home?hl=en-US&gl=US) for automatic updates or directly via this [link](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/products/power-bi/downloads) as a standalone installer.
