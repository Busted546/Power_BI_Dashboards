## ðŸ“„ Project Description
This Power BI case study project simulates a consulting engagement for HealthStat, a fictional analytics firm tasked with evaluating hospital efficiency using real-world healthcare data. The primary focus is to analyze the factors that influence patient length of stay (LOS) and cost per discharge while uncovering performance outliers across hospitals.

By applying data modeling, DAX functions, and advanced visualizations, the project culminates in a branded, interactive, three-page dashboard that enables stakeholders to make data-driven decisions aimed at improving hospital efficiency without compromising the quality of patient care.

## ðŸ§° Tools Used
- Power BI Desktop
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
- Power Query
- Key Influencers Visualization
- Bookmarks, Tooltips & Drillthroughs

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights
- Build an efficient data model by importing and transforming real-world hospital data.
- Develop DAX measures and calculated columns to support robust analytics.
- Explore patterns and outliers in total discharges, length of stay, and patient costs.
- Identify key drivers influencing hospital performance.
- Present findings in a polished, interactive dashboard customized with HealthStat branding.

 ## ðŸ§  Target Audience
 - Healthcare administrators and hospital managers
 - Policy analysts and consultants at HealthStat
 - Public health officials monitoring hospital efficiency
 - Stakeholders interested in length of stay and cost trends

## ðŸ“Œ How to Use the Dashboard
